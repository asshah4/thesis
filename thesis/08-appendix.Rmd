### Poincaré Plot of HRV {#FigurePoincare}

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width = "110%"}
knitr::include_graphics("refs/poincare.jpg")
```

The two Poincaré plots represent ECG data at 7 AM for a twin pair that are discordant for stress test results. Both axes are RR interval lengths in milliseconds. The x-axis coordinate represents the RR interval for an initial beat, while the y-axis coordinate represents the RR interval for the following beat, such that the (x, y) coordinate represents (RRn, RRn+1). Each subsequent coordinate is plotted in this way. The red points are beats that were slower than the previous beat, while the blue points were faster than the previous beat. The shape of the resulting plot is abstracted into a single descriptive index called Dyx. The first twin (left) had no myocardial perfusion deficits on stress testing with a Dyx = 3.7. The second twin (right) had an abnormal stress test with a Dyx = 1.7. This is referenced with permission [@Shah2020].
