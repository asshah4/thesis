# (PART\*) DISCUSSION {-}

# Major Findings

- Aim 1: HRV and MPI/CAD on cath
- Aim 2: HRV and acute/chronic mental stress
- Aim 3: HRV and MACE

- HRV not associated with obstructive CAD or percent stenosis
- MPI however is strongly related, particularly with mental stress (MSIMI)
- CFR and HRV more strongly related than with MPI
- Circadian pattern / nature to relationship
- Dyx was higher in those with CAD
- DYX but not HRV associated with abnormal MPI
- HRV associated with CFR more than MPI

- HRV not strongly associated by PHQ-9 
- HRV strongly related to PTSD and MDD
- PTSD and depression both related to circadian HRV

- HRV strongly predicts clinical outcomes
- Twins and MIMS similar
- circadian prediction is present
