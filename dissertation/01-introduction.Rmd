# The Problem

> "Why did he die on Tuesday and not on Monday?"

1.  Research problem

- Mental stress can cause changes in the brain
- These changes can lead to depression and psych disease
- Those changes lead to increased cardiovascular disease
- Patients that are comorbid with psych and CAD do worse clinically

The underlying concept in the question posed by Dr. Zipes is that the cardiac substrate is can be triggered into an catastrophic maelstrom [@Zipes2010]. 
That trigger is oftentimes psychological in nature [@Lown1979].
Depression, for example, is the leading cause of disabilty in the world [@Friedrich2017b], and CAD is the leading cause of death [@McAloon2016b]. 
The prevalence of depression is 20% in patients with CAD, and in those with comorbid depression and CAD, there is a 3-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality [@Jha2019; Meijer2011].
By understanding how the body reacts to mental stress, we can learn how to control and modify these triggers to prevent cardiovascular mortality.

1.  Purpose of research

- Purpose of research is to see if physiological and psychological stress can be measured
- Attempt to quantify the neurocardiac axis by measuring ANS function from neural perspective and from cardiac perspective
- Leveraging different types of "stress" to help answer this question
- Stress = myocardial ischemia, chronic psychological, acute mental stress, circadian/diurnal 


# The Approach

1.  Underlying causal mechanisms

Part of this increased mortality is likely due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system [@Stein2000].
