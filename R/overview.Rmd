# Introduction


### Thesis Overview

- Temporal relationship of ANS dysfunction with psychological and cardiac disease
   - __Acute__: the active stressor, such as mental stress or acute coronary reperfusion
   - __Daily__: both daily and circadian parameters and cross-sectional relationships
   - __Longitudinal__: effect of ANS function on clinical outcomes
   
- Neurocardiology assumes ANS is bidirectional bridge between heart and brain
   - Limitations in ability to non-invasively measure ANS function
   - Prevalent in many disease states (e.g. depression increases risk of CV disease)
   - ECG and signal-processing methods can help assess these changes in short-term and long-term recordings

# Background I

.center[
_Heart rate variability (HRV) can represent the current state of the ANS as a potential "biomarker" of neurocardiac health._

### Heart rate fluctuations

- Fluctuations in the HR are mediated by sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) inputs to the sinoatrial node
- Rapid fluctuations in HR reflect vagal/PNS control
- Slower fluctuations in HR reflect SNS and PNS integartion, along with other influences
]

### Relevant factors

- External influences such as activity, mental stress, etc
- Internal period rhythms also exist: RSA, baroreceptor reflexes, circadian rhythm, RAAS/neuroendocrine secretions, etc

# Background II

.pull-left[
## Psychological distress

- Acute stressors, such as a mental stress challenge, can lead to increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal
- Psychological distress, such as psychiatric illness including depression and anxiety, can lead to changes in ANS function
- Psychosocial stress, such as chronic vital exhaustion and social isolation, can lead to chronic changes in ANS function
- However, ANS function may be protective by providing resilience to psychosocial stress

## Cardiovascular disease

- Afferent pathways from cardiovascular disease can lead to both acute and chronic changes in ANS function
- Coronary occlusion, from perhaps myocardial infarction, leads to strong ANS response through afferent systems
- Chronic cardiovascular disease, can lead to a persistently elevated ANS response, e.g. resting tachycardia
- ANS dysfunction likely effects not only SA/AV nodal function, but myocardial inotropy, systemic vascular tone, and coronary resistance vessels

# Aims 

Using available clinical data, will review the relationship of autonomic dysfunction with neurocardiac changes acutely, over the course of a day, and over the course of months to years.

1. __Examine the relationship of acute HRV changes with coronary perfusion/reperfusion and psychological distress__ (Biobank)
	
2. __Examine the relationship of daily HRV with changes in psychological distress and myocardial perfusion, including acute mental stress and chronic__ (MIMS/MIPS, Twins)
	
3. __Examine the relationship of circadian HRV at predicting long-term events based on mental stress and autononomic function__ (MIMS/MIPS, Twins)

4. __Explore the utility of advanced harmonic regression modeling and feature reduction methods in ECG signal processing techniques in statistical analysis__ (Biobank, MIMS/MIPS, Twins)

# Hypotheses

Based off the aims, the following hypotheses are expected:

- Coronary disease will show an acute and chronic relationship with HRV, including a difference between epicardial and resistance vessel disease

- Psychological stress will show an acute and chronic relationship with HRV, including differences in circadian rhythm

- Changes in autonomic function coupled with abnormal neurocardiac pathology will show an additive effect of increased mortality

# Study Design

_Due to COVID-19, the datasets are reduced in size, and alternative data sources were used_.

### Data collection

- Emory Cardiovascular Biobank - continually enrolling, however limited by COVID
- Emory Twins Study - enrollment and follow-up data is completed and available
- MIMS/MIPS - enrollment and follow-up data is completed and available

### Study Overview

Emory Biobank: Psychological factors and HRV collected on patients undergoing coronary angiography.

Emory Twins Study: Veteran twins present for clinical profiling, Holter monitoring, and quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging. Follow-up for outcomes.

MIMS/MIPS: Mental stress study looking at inducible myocardial ischemia and clinical outcomes. HRV collected before, during, and after mental stressors.
