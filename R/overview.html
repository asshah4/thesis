# Introduction

### Thesis Overview

- Temporal relationship of ANS dysfunction with psychological and cardiac disease
   - **Acute**: the active stressor, such as mental stress or acute coronary reperfusion
   - **Diurnal: both daily and circadian parameters and cross-sectional relationships
   - **Longitudinal**: effect of ANS function on clinical outcomes
   
- Neurocardiology assumes ANS is bidirectional bridge between heart and brain
   - Limitations in ability to non-invasively measure ANS function
   - Prevalent in many disease states (e.g. depression increases risk of CV disease)
   - ECG and signal-processing methods can help assess these changes in short-term and long-term recordings

# Background I

.center[
*Heart rate variability (HRV) can represent the current state of the ANS as a potential "biomarker" of neurocardiac health.*
]

.pull-left[
### Heart rate fluctuations

- Fluctuations in the HR are mediated by sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) inputs to the sinoatrial node
- Rapid fluctuations in HR reflect vagal/PNS control
- Slower fluctuations in HR reflect SNS and PNS integartion, along with other influences
]

.pull-right[
### Relevant factors

- External influences such as activity, mental stress, etc
- Internal period rhythms also exist: RSA, baroreceptor reflexes, circadian rhythm, RAAS/neuroendocrine secretions, etc
]

---
# Background II

.pull-left[
## Psychological distress

- Acute stressors, such as a mental stress challenge, can lead to increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal
- Psychological distress, such as psychiatric illness including depression and anxiety, can lead to changes in ANS function
- Psychosocial stress, such as chronic vital exhaustion and social isolation, can lead to chronic changes in ANS function
- However, ANS function may be protective by providing resilience to psychosocial stress
]

.pull-right[
## Cardiovascular disease

- Afferent pathways from cardiovascular disease can lead to both acute and chronic changes in ANS function
- Coronary occlusion, from perhaps myocardial infarction, leads to strong ANS response through afferent systems
- Chronic cardiovascular disease, can lead to a persistently elevated ANS response, e.g. resting tachycardia
- ANS dysfunction likely effects not only SA/AV nodal function, but myocardial inotropy, systemic vascular tone, and coronary resistance vessels

# Aims I

Using available clinical data, will review the relationship of autonomic dysfunction with neurocardiac changes acutely, over the course of a day, and over the course of months to years.

1. **Examine the relationship of acute HRV changes with coronary perfusion/reperfusion and psychological distress** (Biobank)
	
1. **Examine the relationship of daily HRV with changes in psychological distress and myocardial perfusion, including acute mental stress and chronic stress** (MIMS/MIPS, Twins)
	
1. **Examine the relationship of circadian HRV at predicting long-term events based on mental stress and autononomic function** (MIMS/MIPS, Twins, ARIC)

1. **Explore the utility of advanced harmonic regression modeling and feature reduction methods in ECG signal processing techniques in statistical analysis** (Biobank, MIMS/MIPS, Twins)

---
# Aims II

The background work supporting the aims is as follows:

- ECG signal for Biobank, Twins, MIMS/MIPS has been generated previously

- HRV and perfusion data has been shown to be related in a circadian fashion [1]

- HRV and long-term outcomes has been shown to effect psychosocial factors and mortality/morbidity [2]

- Harmonic regression methods have been developed for analyzing diurnal data [3]

# Hypotheses

- Coronary disease will show an acute and chronic relationship with HRV, including a difference between epicardial and resistance vessel disease

- Psychological stress will show an acute and chronic relationship with HRV, including differences in circadian rhythm

- Changes in autonomic function coupled with abnormal neurocardiac pathology will show an additive effect of increased mortality

# Study Design I

### Study Overview and Data Collection 

*Emory Biobank*: Psychological factors and HRV collected on patients undergoing coronary angiography. Currently enrolling rare patients. [1]

*Emory Twins Study*: Veteran twins present for clinical profiling, Holter monitoring, and quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging. Follow-up for outcomes. Enrollment and follow-up complete.

*MIMS/MIPS*: Mental stress study looking at inducible myocardial ischemia and clinical outcomes. HRV collected before, during, and after mental stressors. Enrollment and follow-up complete.

*ARIC*: Large epidemiology dataset with &gt;20+ years of patient follow-up, including short-term HRV and several time points. Enrollment and follow-up complete.

# Study Design II

### ECG Measures

Within the several datasets that will be used, ECG is collected in a raw format in the Emory Biobank, Twins, MIMS/MIPS and has already been processed to different HRV signals, including morphology changes. In ARIC, this data has been pre-processed to HRV.

### Coronary/cardiovascular measures

Within the Biobank, coronary angiography data is collected, including intervention. Within Twins, quantitative PET data has been collected and analyzed (showing myocardial perfusion data and coronary flow reserve).

### Clinical/psychological measures

For both Biobank (PHQ-9), MIMS/MIPS (BDI), and Twins (BDI), ARIC (vital exhaustion), extensive clinical and psychological profiling is available. MIMS/MIPS in addition includes a mental-stress challenge during their study visit.

# Analytical Plans I

## Acute Changes

1. Assess pre/post reperfusion HRV, with controls being patients with no intervention. Further adjustment for coronary stenosis. (**Biobank**)
   - Coronary angiography scores and pre/post flow rates after intervention 
   - Include effect of depression (PHQ-9) on HRV (additional covariate and/or strata)

1. Effect of acute mental stress on HRV (**MIMS/MIPS**)
   - Effect of acute mental stress and immediate changes in HRV
   - Assess relationship of mental stress and HRV "recovery" to baseline
   - Relationship between those with and without MSIMI (mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia) and HRV
   
---
# Analytical Plans II

## Diurnal Changes

1. Create and implement a harmonic regression model with multiple components to assess ECG features 
   - Assess implementation in 24 hour datasets (**Biobank** and **Twins**)
   - Assess implementation in &gt;24 hour datasets (**Twins** and **MIMS/MIPS**)
   - Assess implementation in &lt;12 hour datasets (**MIMS/MIPS**)
   
1. Using cosinor regression to assess relationship of ECG with...
   - Myocardial perfusion abnormalities (**Twins**)
   - Depression via BDI and PHQ-9 (**Twins** and **Biobank**)
   - MSIMI (**MIMS/MIPS**)

	
---
# Analytical Plans III

## Longitudinal changes

1. Model relationship of circadian/cosinor ECG with future events
   - With adjustment for clinical/psychological covariates (**Twins**)
   - With adjustment/stratification by MSIMI (**MIMS/MIPS**)
   
1. Examine relationship of changes in HRV with long-term outcomes
   - Psychosocial stress including vital exhaustion, social isolation, and anger proneness (**ARIC**)

---
# Results and Conclusions

The analyses are in various stages of work, outlined here:

- Twins data has published analysis on circadian patterns on myocardial perfusion, longitudinal outcomes and relationship to depression are pending
- Biobank data has been collected, but comparative analyses has not been completed
- MIMS/MIPS data has been collected, and preliminary analyses have begun
- ARIC data and longitudinal outcomes have been analyzed, with association of mortality and HRV as an additive effect to psychosocial stress
