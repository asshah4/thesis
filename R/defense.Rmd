## Clinical Relevance

- Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death and psychological diseases, e.g. depression, are the leading cause of disability **worldwide** `r Citep(bib, c("McAloon2016b", "Friedrich2017b"))`
- Cardiovascular disease is comorbid with psychological disease, e.g. 20% of patients with CAD have depression, with subsequent 3 times greater risk of mortality `r Citep(bib, c("Meijer2011", "Jha2019"))`
- Acute mental stress leads to increased risk of myocardial ischemia and is suggestive of worse outcomes `r Citep(bib, "Vaccarino2018")`
- Chronic stress can lead to autonomic changes over time `r Citep(bib, "Shah2020a")`

## Neurocardiac Axis

.pull-left[
Multiple levels of neural regulation of cardiac physiology:

- Intrinsic cardiac nervous system
- Intrathoracic cardiac nervous system
- Central nervous system

There are both **afferent** and **efferent** systems interactions.

*Ex: psychological stress can cause an increased heart rate, or a heart attack can lead to feelings of anxiety or nervousness*

Theoretical model of how neural and psychological factors effect .teal[sinoatrial node] function, coronary blood flow, and .teal[myocardial repolarization].

Clinically, cardiovascular outcomes have neurocardiac mechanisms.

With ECG, we can measure these effects through **heart rate variability** and changes in **morphology**.

<br>
```{r, out.height="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("refs/2018-kentta-twa.png")
```
]

.right-column[
**Heart Rate Variability**

- Fluctuations in HR are mediated by sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) inputs to the .teal[sinoatrial node]
- Rapid changes reflect vagal/PNS control
- Slower changes reflect SNS and PNS integration
- External factors: activity, mental stress, etc
- Internal factors: respiration, baroreceptor reflexes, circadian rhythm, RAAS, neuroendocrine, etc.

**Morphology**

- ECG changes reflect how the heart repolarizes after each beat
- T-wave area correlates with sympathetic tone `r Citep(bib, "Kentta2018")`

# METHODS

---

## Study Design

The Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress (MIMS) and Mental Stress Ischemia Mechanisms and Prognosis Study (MIPS) are similar observational, cross-sectional studies. Patients after recent catheterization for chest pain or abnormal stress test enrolled (Grady and Emory). They returned for first visit within 6 months of event. 

- *Coronary Artery Disease*: Stress test performed initially using either mental/physical stress. Qualitative myocardial perfusion imaging performed on all patients
- *Electrocardiography*: 1-lead to 12-lead ECG monitors were placed. Signal transformed to HRV using MATLAB `r Citep(bib, "Vest2018")`, with all HRV metrics log-transformed prior to analysis
- *Mental Stress*: Depression and PTSD data collected using DSM-IV standardized questionnaires, mental stress challenge also performed
- *Outcomes*: Adjudicated outcome events (MACE, hospitalization, etc) are collected

---

## AIM I

.pull-left[

**To assess the association between myocardial ischemia and coronary perfusion changes in cardiac autonomic activity.**

*Hypothesis:*

Decreased HRV to rest and stress provocation will associate with increased odds ratio for mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia compared with physical stress-induced myocardial ischemia.
]

.pull-right[
*Plan:*

- Assess association between HRV (exposure) and physical stress-induced myocardial ischemia (outcome) in logistic regression models
- Assess association between HRV (exposure) and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (outcome) in logistic regression models
]

---

## AIM II

.pull-left[

**To determine if cardiac autonomic activity modifies the relationship between acute and chronic psychological stress and myocardial ischemia.**

*Hypothesis:*

Decreased HRV to rest and stress provocation is associated with acute mental stress and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia, and after adjustment for both clinical and chronic mental stressors (depression and PTSD).
]

.pull-right[
*Plan:*

- Compare HRV before, during and after mental stress challenge using **t-tests**
- Assess association between HRV (exposure) and depression/PTSD diagnosis (outcome) in **logistic regression** models
- Assess association between HRV (exposure) and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (outcome) in **logistic regression** models, with sequential adjustment for clinical covariates
]

---

## AIM III

.pull-left[

**To explore the association of cardiac autonomic activity with future major adverse cardiovascular events.**   

*Hypothesis:*

Decreased HRV during rest and stress provocation is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, and mediates the increased mortality seen with mental stress induced myocardial ischemia.
]

.pull-right[
*Plan:*

- Cumulative incidence curves for overall mortality
- Evaluate effect of HRV on hazard ratio of cardiovascular mortality and recurrent events using **Cox proportional hazard models**
- Evaluate effect of HRV on hazard ratio of MSIMI on cardiovascular mortality  and recurrent MACE

MSIMI is associated with both low and high frequency HRV. The relationship is most prominently seen with .teal[HF HRV]. There is an OR of 0.5 for developing MSIMI for every 1 unit increase in HRV (log ms<sup>2</sup>)

# DISCUSSION

---

## Key Findings

--

- Decreased HRV is associated with abnormal myocardial perfusion, particularly in those with MSIMI (.yellow[Aim I])

--

- Acute mental stress is associated with decreased HRV (.yellow[Aim II])

--

- Decreased HRV is associated with MSIMI in adjusted models (.yellow[Aim II])

--

- Decreased HRV has a similar increased hazard for mortality as MSIMI in survival analysis (.yellow[Aim III])

--

- Decreased HRV is an effect modifier for the increased hazard for mortality from MSIMI (.yellow[Aim III])

---

## Interpretation

- Resting heart rate was associated with both depression and PTSD, suggesting that a central mechanism is likely sympathovagal imbalance

- MSIMI was most strongly associated with decreased HF, suggesting vagal withdrawal and potential baroreceptor dysfunction

- Autonomic dysfunction, particularly as a result of acute stressors, may be the mechanism by which MSIMI leads to increased cardiovascular mortality and events

---

.pull-left[
### Limitations

- Limited enrollment for adequate power of .yellow[Aim I]
- Interpreting censoring events has limitations, as obtained from secondary sources
- Quality of ECG signal is non-uniform
- Multiple hypothesis testing with highly correlated data is more complex
- Relationship between HRV and chronic stress not as robust
]

.pull-right[
### Strengths

- Findings from MIMS/MIPS are parallel to findings in Twins analysis, suggesting generalizability
- HRV processing similar between studies
- Highlights importance of autonomic function in neurocardiac axis
]

---

## Future Directions


.pull-left[
1. Assess effects of coronary artery disease using angiography in a well-powered cohort

1. Analyze relationships of HRV with types of outcomes

1. Study effect of circadian changes in HRV with relationship to depression and PTSD, and relationship with future hazard for cardiovascular mortality
